# Dynamic Pricing Model App

This is a Streamlit web application that implements a dynamic pricing model for ride-sharing services. The app allows users to input various parameters and get a predicted ride price based on the trained Random Forest Regressor model. 

## Features

- Predict ride prices based on user inputs such as number of riders, number of drivers, vehicle type, and expected ride duration.
- Visualize the predicted ride prices against actual values using Plotly graphs.
- Provide insights into the distribution of profitable and loss rides.
- Handle missing data through preprocessing techniques.
- Incorporate a Random Forest Regressor model to predict prices.
